# The SparksFoundation/TASK 1, STUDENT HOURS SCORE PREDICTION
 
This was the very first task of this internship, I went through many challenges working on this task. The language used was Python and Jupyter Notebook IDE was used, for better plots and better visualisation. There were couple of libraries which made this task more enhancing, those are mentioned below,

1.) Seaborn:- This basically generates plots for visualisation, whitout seaborn data visualisation isn't possible.

2.) Matplotlib:- This is another library which is used for plots, namely calculative plots.

3.) Pandas:- Pandas is used for accessing csv and xlsx files, which is used for further visualisation.

4.) Numpy:- Used for calculative purposes.

5.) Ignore Warnings:- This basically ignores warniings gievn by the IDE.

Attached ipynb file will guide you in a better way.
